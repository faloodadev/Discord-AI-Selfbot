## 🎯 How It Works

Cuss will **automatically respond** when:

1. **Someone mentions her**: `@cuss.ly hey!`
2. **Someone replies to her messages**: Just hit reply
3. **Someone says her name**: Type `cuss` anywhere in the message
4. **In DMs**: She'll respond to any DM (if enabled)
5. **In group chats**: She'll respond to group messages (if enabled)

**No setup needed!** Just start talking to her in any Discord channel.

1. **Enable realistic typing** for most natural feel:
   ```
   ~toggletyping
   ```

2. **Control from anywhere** - DM yourself and use it as a control panel

3. **Send her aesthetic images** - She'll analyze and possibly change her PFP

4. **Set mood before conversations** for appropriate vibe

## ⚙️ Optional: Manual Channel Activation

While Cuss responds automatically everywhere, you can still use:

```
~toggleactive <channel_id>
```

This marks specific channels as "active" but is **completely optional** now!
